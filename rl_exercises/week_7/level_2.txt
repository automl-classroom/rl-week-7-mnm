Intrinsic Rewards
While the Intrinsic rewards start relatively high it decreases with more steps taken.
This indicates that as the agent explores increasingly more, less states are novel
and the prediction error between the random network and the predictor decreases.
Thus novelty rewards are given at early stages and are reduced over time.


Extrinsic Rewards
Unlike intrinsic reward, the extrinsic reward does not show a clear upward trend.
This could be due to insufficient exploitation or conflictiong reward signals between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.
